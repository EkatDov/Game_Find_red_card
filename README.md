## Why I am doing this
This is an extremely simple and minimalistic game that I am writing to test out the following development concepts and their interaction:
- Model-View-Controller
- Client-Server

## Rules of the game
There are two cards on the screen. Their colour is hidden.
The objective of the game is to find which of the two cards is red.
Click on the card to reveal its colour.
Right mouse click resets the game.
